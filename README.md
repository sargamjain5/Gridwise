# GridWise

**GridWise** is an AI-powered urban mobility and parking intelligence platform built for **Bangalore Police** (enforcement) and **citizens** (smart parking, congestion reduction, and violation reporting).

It combines **predictive analytics, computer vision, and geospatial intelligence** to optimize parking utilization, improve traffic flow, and automate violation detection.

Built with **React, TypeScript, Vite, FastAPI, XGBoost, YOLOv8, EasyOCR, and Leaflet**.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### 3. Generate ML predictions (Optional)

This trains all models and exports predictions to `public/ml_models.json`.

```bash
cd models

python train_all.py
```

Training takes approximately **40–60 seconds**.

---

### 4. Start the ANPR backend (Optional)

This enables real-time vehicle and license plate detection.

```bash
cd models

python server.py
```

Backend:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Swagger documentation:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Health check:

```
http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Dataset Setup

**Do not upload the dataset to GitHub.**

Place the file below manually inside the `models/` folder before training:

```text
models/jan to may police violation_anonymized791b166.csv
```

Then run:

```bash
cd models

python train_all.py
```
